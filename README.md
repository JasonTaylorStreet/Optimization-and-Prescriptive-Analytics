# Optimization-and-Prescriptive-Analytics
Optimization is a prescriptive analytics methodology designed to yield the best solution to a given problem. This applied optimization course will examine optimization through a business analytics lens. Students are exposed to the theory and application of optimization, including linear programming, nonlinear programming, discrete optimization, specialized networks and heuristics. Students will develop an understanding of algebraic formulations, develop spreadsheet model prototypes and use large-scale optimization software to solve challenging business problems.
